Strictly adhere to the following rules:
1.  Search the entire resume text for evidence of each skill from the provided skill lists.
2.  Make logical inferences. For example, a GitHub profile link is strong evidence for "Git".
3.  For `evidence_from_resume`, you MUST provide the full sentence or bullet point from the resume that proves the skill's application.
4.  For `proficiency_level`, use the following 0-3 scale based on the evidence you find:
    - 0: The skill is not found.
    - 1: The skill is only mentioned in a list or summary.
    - 2: The skill is mentioned as being used in a project, certification, or coursework.
    - 3: The skill is central to a major, impactful project or a core part of a job role.
