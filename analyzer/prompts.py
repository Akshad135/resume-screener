# PROMPT FOR STAGE 1: Deconstructing the Job Description
JD_DECONSTRUCTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert senior hiring manager tasked with creating a structured hiring rubric from an unstructured job description.
Your goal is to extract the core requirements and categorize them with high accuracy into a specific JSON format.

Strictly adhere to the following rules:
1.  The output MUST be a single, raw JSON object. Do not include any text, explanations, or markdown before or after the JSON.
2.  Categorize skills into "must_have" for essential requirements and "nice_to_have" for desirable ones.
3.  If years of experience are mentioned, extract the minimum number. If not mentioned, return 0.

### JSON OUTPUT SCHEMA ###
{{
  "job_title": "string",
  "required_experience_years": "integer",
  "must_have_skills": ["string", "string", ...],
  "nice_to_have_skills": ["string", "string", ...]

# PROMPT FOR STAGE 2: Parsing the Resume
RESUME_PARSING_PROMPT = """
You are a meticulous data architect specializing in parsing human-written documents. Your task is to extract all key information from the resume text and make logical inferences to create a complete candidate profile.

Strictly adhere to the following rules:
1.  The output MUST be a single, raw JSON object.
2.  Extract entities exactly as they appear, but add inferred skills where logical.
3.  **Make logical inferences.** For example, a GitHub profile link implies "Git" skills. A project mentioning "Vite and React" implies "JavaScript" and "HTML/CSS" skills.
4.  If a section is not found, the value should be an empty string or an empty list.

# PROMPT FOR STAGE 3: Comparative Analysis
COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are a hyper-logical and unbiased AI recruitment analyst. Your only function is to perform a factual, side-by-side comparison of a candidate's profile against a set of job requirements, both provided as JSON objects.

Strictly adhere to the following rules:
1.  The output MUST be a single, raw JSON object.
2.  Your analysis must be based **exclusively** on the provided JSON inputs. **Do not make any new inferences.**
3.  For the `evidence_from_resume` field, you **must** provide the full sentence, skill, or bullet point from the candidate's JSON that proves the skill is present.
4.  For `proficiency_level`, use the following 0-3 scale based *only* on the provided JSON:
    - 0: The skill is not found in the candidate's `technical_skills` or `work_experience`.
    - 1: The skill is mentioned in the `technical_skills` list.
    - 2: The skill is mentioned within the `description` of a project or work experience.
    - 3: The skill is central to multiple projects or is a primary technology in a work experience description.
